# 🚀 Web Server – The Chill Deploy Machine

Welcome to the repo where the magic happens.  
This is the home of a **corporate-looking website with a not-so-corporate personality**, deployed automatically to both **Azure VM** and **GitHub Pages** — because why choose one when you can flex with two?

## ? What This Project Does

Whenever you push something to the **main** branch:

1. GitHub goes: “Oh, you changed something again?”  
2. GitHub Actions springs into action, SSHs into an Azure VM, and updates the site like a loyal robot butler 🤖  
3. GitHub Pages mirrors the site and proudly says: “Look, I can host it too!”

✨ **1 commit = 2 deploys = 0 drama**

---

## 🎯 Goal

Create a clean corporate website and give it a deployment pipeline that’s so automatic it feels like cheating.

Spoiler: it’s not.  
But it *does* feel awesome.
