😎 Slawinski Web Server – The Chill Deploy Machine
Welcome to the repo where the magic happens.
This is the home of a corporate-looking website with a not-so-corporate personality, deployed automatically to both Azure VM and GitHub Pages — because why choose one when you can flex with two?

🚀 What This Project Does
Whenever you push something to the main branch:


GitHub goes: “Oh, you changed something again?”


GitHub Actions springs into action (pun 100% intended), SSHs into an Azure VM, and updates the site like a loyal robot butler 🤖


GitHub Pages mirrors the site and whispers: “Look, I can host it too!”


In short:
✨ 1 commit = 2 deploys = 0 drama

🎯 Goal
Create a clean corporate website and give it a deployment pipeline that’s so automatic it feels like cheating.
Spoiler: it’s not.
But it does feel awesome.

🧰 Tech Stack


HTML/CSS (corporate look, startup soul)


GitHub Actions (your new employee of the month)


Azure VM + Apache (doing the heavy lifting)


GitHub Pages (the fancy static mirror)



🔌 Automatic Deploy Workflow
Every time you push:


Azure VM updates itself ✨


GitHub Pages updates itself ✨


You do absolutely nothing ✨


Productivity skyrockets 🚀

Built by Slawinski — now officially a Cloud Wizard, CI/CD Tamer, and Person Who No Longer Fears YAML.
Feel free to copy this idea and pretend it took forever.

If you want, I can also create:


a super serious corporate README,


a full comedy README,


or a fantasy storytelling version (“The Legend of the Azure VM”).
